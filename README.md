**<ins>Dashboard Purpose</ins>**
<br> The sales manager came to me saying that she wants to know the sales performance right now, so I built a sales dashboard that present an overview of the sales metrics and trends in order to understand sales trend and analyze year-over-year sales performance, providing business insights.

**<ins>Key Components</ins>**
- **KPI Overview:** display a summary of total sales, profit, and quantity for the current year and the previous year -> BANs
- **Sales Trends:** present the data for each KPI on a monthly basis for both the current year and the previous year -> Sparkline chart
- **Product Subcategory Comparison:** compare sales performance by different product subcategories for the current year and the previous year, including a comparison of sales with profit. -> Bar chart
- **Customer Acquisition by Order Quantity:** compare customer growth based on rank of order quantity along market by regions

**<ins>Design & Interactivity</ins>**
- The Dashboard allow users to filter data by market and by customer segment.
- Provide users with the ability to navigate between the dashboards easily.
